# NOTE: Explanation of coordinate system:
# Pygame uses x and y to store coordinates.
# An important difference between pygame and how coordinates work in math
# is that in pygame y = 0 is at the top of the screen.
# That means adding to y will bring something lower on the screen, which is confusing.

# NOTE: Explanation of vectors:
# In pygame, a Vector2 is a way of storing an x and y variable in a single place.
# This program uses Vector2s to store the ship's position and velocity.
# It's convenient to store the ship's velocity as x and y in a single vector and
# to add it to the ship's position every frame. The position is also a Vector2 and Vector2s can be conveniently added together.
# The x and y in a vector make up a triangle. The hypotenuse of that triangle is the magnitude of the vector.
